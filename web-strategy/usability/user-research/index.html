Once the product is being used, it assists with finding areas for improvement and planning for additional features.</p>
				  	<p>Focusing design and development deliverables on these needs will lead to:</p>
				  	<ul class="list-unstyled lead">
					  	<li>Increased adoption of new tools.</li>
					  	<li>Improved user experience of the tool.</li>
					  	<li>increased satisfaction with ITS.</li>
				  	</ul>
				  	<p>In addition, user research methods highlight problems and hard-to-use elements earlier in design and development, allowing projects the ability to shift course nimbly, rather than missing deadlines due to later rework or releasing less usable tools with the intention of "fixing it later."</p>
