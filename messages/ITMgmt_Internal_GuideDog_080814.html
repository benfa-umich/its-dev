<p>Hi fellow ITS staff,</p>

<p>My name is Erin Lauridsen, and I joined ITS in February as a screen reader specialist within the Assistive Technology department. For those of you I haven't met personally, you may recognize me as the staff member who uses a white cane. I'll soon be navigating campus with a guide dog, and wanted to ask for your cooperation as I bring this trained canine professional on board.</p>

<p>Please don't talk to, touch, or otherwise distract the dog when it is working. When the dog is working, it will wear a leather guide dog harness. Not distracting the dog is especially important when the dog and I are walking together, as the dog's concentration affects my safety. However, the dog is also working when it is sitting or lying quietly next to me, at those times its job is to be well behaved and unobtrusive. When the dog's harness is off for a break, it may be appropriate to meet it, but please ask me first. When the dog is new, we will still be bonding as partners, and I will need to limit the dog's interactions with other people. </p>

<p>Please don't give the dog food or treats; it is important that all rewards come from me. This helps the bonding process, and prevents the dog from being distracted when it accompanies me to public places such as restaurants.</p>

<p>Please do talk to me if you have questions or concerns about having a guide dog in our workplace. A few frequently asked questions are below. Thanks for your time.</p>

<p><em>Erin</em></p>

<p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:normal;"><strong>Frequently Asked Questions</strong></p>

<p><strong>Why can you bring a dog to work?</strong><br/>
The Americans with Disabilities Act permits trained service dogs to travel with their handlers in businesses and other public places. You can read more about this at: <a href="http://www.ada.gov/service_animals_2010.htm">http://www.ada.gov/service_animals_2010.htm</a></p>

<p><strong>How does the dog know where to go?</strong><br/>
As the handler, I am responsible for directing the dog as to our route of travel. The dog is responsible for leading me in a straight line, avoiding obstacles, and stopping for elevation changes and other hazards. Guide dogs do learn the pattern of familiar landmarks and turns.</p>

<p><strong>Why are you still training the dog?</strong><br/>
The dog has passed a rigorous training program, but its learning is ongoing. You may observe me teaching the dog new behaviors with food rewards, verbal commands, or leash handling. No one is perfect, so you may also observe me redirecting the dog's focus with these techniques as well.</p>

<p><strong>Does the dog ever get to have fun?</strong><br/>
Yes, when guide dogs are off duty, they play and relax just like a pet. Praise and food rewards from me assure that the dog also enjoys its work.</p>

<p><strong>Is the dog protective of you?</strong><br/>
No, guide dogs are not trained in any form of aggressive or guard dog behavior. In fact, they are well socialized and screened for good temperaments from an early age.</p>
