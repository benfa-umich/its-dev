<h3 style="color:#005696; line-height:normal;">Google or Microsoft @ umich.edu? Help us decide.</h3>

<p>There are over 40 different <nobr>e-mail</nobr> and calendaring systems currently in use across the Michigan campus. Many faculty and staff have told us that this disjointedness in the current IT environment inhibits effective and efficient collaboration on campus and beyond.</p>

<p>Help us decide how the university can significantly and quickly simplify and enhance our available collaborative tools by attending upcoming Google and Microsoft demonstrations. Please visit the <a href="http://nextgen.umich.edu/collaboration-environment.php" target="_blank">registration page</a><span style="display:none;"> [http://nextgen.umich.edu/collaboration-environment.php]</span> for more details and registration information.</p>

<p>The most commonly used collaborative tools on campus include <nobr>e-mail,</nobr> calendaring and scheduling, content sharing, instant messaging, collaborative editing, and discussion forums.</p>

<p>The <nobr>U-M</nobr> <a href="http://nextgen.umich.edu/steering-committee.php" target="_blank">Unit IT Steering Committee</a> has endorsed identifying a new generation of shared collaborative tools that will better serve <nobr>U-M's</nobr> teaching, learning, and scholarly activities. The committee, with representation from all across campus, was established earlier this year as part of a new university IT governance structure to help evaluate and determine campus-wide priorities for IT services, resources, and facilities.</p>

<p>We will send out a brief survey after the conclusion of the Google and Microsoft presentations.  Your input is very important in making determinations about which collaboration tools to select and what functionality is most crucial. We want to hear from you even if you don't attend the sessions.  The survey is designed to provide us with more data about current capabilities, desired collaboration tool functionality, and any concerns we need to account for and understand.  We will share with campus the feedback we receive.</p>

<p>Improving our collective ability to collaborate on campus&mdash;and across the world&mdash;is an important step in the transformation of IT at Michigan. For more information, go to <a href="http://nextgen.umich.edu/" target="_blank">nextgen.umich.edu</a>.</p>
