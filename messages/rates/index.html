<p>Hello [Dean Name],</p>

<p>ITS sends the annual rates letter to provide your unit with a better view of your ITS expenses to help you prepare for the next fiscal year, as well as provide an update on any upcoming changes to the service and technology trends in higher education. In the past, units, schools and colleges received cost estimates for voice and data networking. Beginning in FY14, we included rates to help units, schools and colleges estimate costs for other IT services.</p>

<p>ITS is working to better understand costs and attribute expenses more effectively. By doing this, we can more clearly communicate what services cost and what you get for your money. Additionally, it helps create a better, simpler framework when it comes to funding and chargeback.</p>

<p>Based on your feedback from last year's letter, we included your unit's total billing for last fiscal year, and the current fiscal year to date. Also, this year we included service descriptions and updates for all of the services we included in the letter, not just the ones to which your unit subscribes. We did this to increase transparency of our services, as well as give you information you can use to decide to order new services. The service pages are organized by size of service, so that you can see where your unit is spending the most money first. Finally, we've consolidated information about rate types, how to order and learn more about our services, and how to ask questions or provide feedback on the following page. </p>

<p>We hope you find this information helpful in your planning, and invite you to reach out to us with any questions, feedback, or concerns by emailing <a href='mailto:lauramp.cio@umich.edu'>lauramp.cio@umich.edu</a>.</p>

<p>Sincerely,</p>

<p>Laura Patterson <br />
Chief Information Officer and Associate Vice President <br />
Information and Technology Services</p>

<p>Jeff Kennedy <br />
Executive Director of Finance <br />
Information and Technology Services</p>
