             <p>Hello deans, directors, and department heads,</p>

             <p>I am pleased to announce that Information and Technology Services 
             (ITS) is working on a priority project to replace the CTools technical 
             infrastructure. This important infrastructure change is necessary to 
             meet the increasing demand for a high-capacity, high-performing, and 
             reliable teaching and learning environment.</p>

             <p>To accomplish these changes, however, a service interruption is 
             needed. At this time, we anticipate that CTools will be unavailable 
             for two weekend days <strong>(Saturday, June 30, 2012 through Sunday, 
             July 1, 2012).</strong> This will allow for complete replacement of 
             the server infrastructure and extensive testing.</p>

             <p>As a mission-critical teaching and learning service used by students, 
             faculty, and staff throughout the university, we understand that there 
             is never a good time for CTools to be off-line and unavailable. Based 
             on historical CTools usage data and published 2012 academic calendars, 
             we selected dates that we believe avoid disruption to the vast majority 
             of the University&#39;s academic cycles.</p>

             <p>If there are critical academic activities during this timeframe that 
             could be affected, please contact me as soon as possible at 
             <a href="mailto:CTools.2012.Outage@umich.edu" 
             target="_blank">CTools.2012.Outage@umich.edu</a>.</p>

             <p>Please feel free to share this information with faculty, staff, and 
             students in your units. We will announce this more broadly to CTools 
             users in the coming weeks and up through the service interruption.</p>

             <p>Thank you for your help and support on this much-needed CTools 
             infrastructure enhancement.</p>

             <p>Regards,<br />
             John Gohsman<br />
             Executive Director, NextGen Michigan Program Office and Teaching and 
             Learning</p>
