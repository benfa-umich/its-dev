<h2 style="color:#005696; line-height:normal;">Invitation to ITS All-Staff Meetings, 
December 17</h2>

<p> Hi Everyone;<br>
Please join Laura Patterson and me at one of two ITS all-staff  meetings on December 
17. Mark your calendar and RSVP for a <a href="http://www.eventbrite.com/event/1023375945">morning 
session on North Campus</a> or an <a href="http://www.eventbrite.com/event/1091846743">afternoon 
session on Central Campus</a>. (A recording  will be available following the 
sessions.)</p>
<p>This meeting is the follow-up session I mentioned in my <a href="https://backstage.itcs.umich.edu/transition/20101117/">webcast</a>. 
Laura and I want to bring you up to date on the progress towards NextGen. We 
will also share more information about the ITS <a href="https://backstage.itcs.umich.edu/transition/rationalization/its-recommendations.php">recommendations</a>, 
which are now available online, and the IT Rationalization Program Office. This 
office will coordinate the planning for, and implementation of, all IT rationalization 
projects. Most importantly, we want to answer your questions. </p>
<p>To enable us to answer as many questions as possible, please <a href="https://backstage.itcs.umich.edu/transition/contact/">submit 
your questions</a> by December 10. Choose &ldquo;All-Staff Meetings&rdquo; as 
your category. You may submit your questions anonymously. We will also answer 
questions from the  audience at the end of the meeting.</p>
<p>Please take some time to review the ITS recommendations and to view my webcast, 
since the meeting on the 17th will refer to these materials.</p>
<p>I know many of you have questions about the campus information sessions. If 
you have campus customers, or feel it&rsquo;s important to hear the campus message, 
you can attend one of the Information Sessions for campus, please check with 
your supervisor and <a href="http://nextgen.umich.edu/rationalization/sessions.php">register</a> 
online. These meetings should not take the place of the ITS-specific meeting, 
which is where you will learn ITS-specific details.</p>
<p>I look forward to providing you with information about the journey that lies 
ahead &ndash; one that promises to be exciting and challenging to us all. </p>
<p>Sincerely,<br>
  John Gohsman<br>
  <em>Executive Director, Application and Information Services, and<br>
  Program Director, IT Rationalization</em></p>
