ITS Connection Points: An All Staff Event



I would like to invite you to attend Connection Points, our first ITS all-staff event for 2013! Sessions will be held on Monday, February 4, 12:30-4 p.m. and Wednesday, February 6, 8-11:30 a.m. in the Michigan League Ballroom. You may attend whichever session best fits your schedule, although I encourage you to coordinate time away from work with your supervisor and colleagues. Please let me know by Friday, January 25, which day you plan to attend. RSVP for the event today.

This event is an opportunity for you and me to connect around the ITS vision, and to have a dialogue about the role we each play in the changes taking place in IT at Michigan. The event planning group hasn't completed the Connection Points agenda because the AVP Lead Team and I are interested in hearing what matters you would like to discuss. We will do our best to tailor the program to those topics you and your colleagues prioritize when RSVP-ing for the event.

Our aim for the event is that you leave feeling more confident in drawing connections between the changes taking place in ITS and the goals of the university, experience stronger connections between your work and the direction of the organization, and gain practical tools for engaging with your colleagues and supervisor in the change process. Here's to an all-staff event that is eye-opening, refreshing, informative, and inspiring, and that helps set the tone for the new year.
