<h2 style="color:#005696; line-height:normal;">Announcing New ITS Logo and Branding 
Guidelines</h2>

<p> Hi Everyone,</p>
<p>I'm really excited about the future vision of NextGen Michigan and what it 
means for ITS and campus. As I shared at our meetings in December, ITS needs 
to change in many ways. It's important that campus views ITS as the preferred 
university shared service and not a separate and sometimes competing IT unit. 
Based on recommendations from the AVPLT, the Communications team, and others 
inside and outside of the organization, I have decided to transition to an ITS 
branding standard that better supports our future direction. Specifically, we 
want to position ITS as the glue for campus IT services and make our website 
a one-stop destination for <em>all</em> IT products and services, whether we 
provide them or not. Our new logo, which is at the top of this e-mail, intentionally 
emphasizes the university instead of the organization.</p>

<p>The new brand identifies ITS services more closely with the university's brand, 
leverages the goodwill and reputation of U-M, and focuses on the university and 
IT as one institution. Here are the main aspects of the change:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A U-M wordmark version of the ITS logo will replace the independent ITS 
logo. This style is the university's standard and preferred approach to branding, 
which all other Business &amp; Finance areas currently use. Please stop using 
the former ITS logo as soon as you can.</li>
  <li>Individual ITS services will be branded based on business content ownership 
or business partner relationship.</li>
  <li>The M-Pathways logo and name will be retired and replaced.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can expect to see the branding applied on a rolling basis over time as 
organizational materials need to be modified or updated. An overview of the brand 
and its applications can be found on the Intranet at <a href="https://backstage.itcs.umich.edu/comm/toolkit/">https://backstage.itcs.umich.edu/comm/toolkit/</a>. 
If you have questions, please ask the Communications team at <a href="mailto:its.communications@umich.edu">its.communications@umich.edu</a>.</p>
<p>In meetings, I receive lots of positive feedback. While our logo is important, 
what really brings a brand to life is the people. Thanks for all you do in support 
of our brand by meeting the IT needs of the campus community.</p>
