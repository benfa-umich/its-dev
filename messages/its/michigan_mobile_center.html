<h2 style="color:#005696;">Launch of the <em>Michigan</em> app and <nobr>U-M</nobr> Mobile Center</h2>

<p>The Mobile Apps Team is excited to announce the launch of two new mobile computing services:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://mobileapps.its.umich.edu/michigan-app?utm_source=targeted%2Bemail&utm_medium=email&utm_term=Michigan%2Bapp&utm_content=first%2Bemail%2Blink&utm_campaign=Michigan%2BApp%2BLaunch">Michigan</a>, a free iPhone app that focuses on campus life and <nobr>U-M</nobr> information</li>

<li><a href="http://mobileapps.its.umich.edu/?utm_source=targeted%2Bemail&utm_medium=email&utm_term=U-M%2BMobile%2BCenter&utm_content=second%2Bemail%2Blink&utm_campaign=Mobile%2BCenter%2BLaunch"><nobr>U-M</nobr> Mobile Center</a>, a toolkit with resources to build apps and a catalog of <nobr>U-M</nobr> mobile apps</li>

</ul>

<p>Michigan and the Mobile Center were created to encourage and support the mobile computing needs at <nobr>U-M.</nobr> Both of these services were collaborative efforts and included participation from students, faculty and staff from departments and schools across campus.In fact the foundation of the Michigan app is iWolverine, an app developed by two undergraduate engineering students.</p>

<p>Our goal is to build a thriving, connected mobile community on campus. To that end, the mobile apps team would value your feedback. As IT experts within the departments and units, you bring a unique perspective to this initiative and we are very interested in <a href="mailto:ITS-Mobile-Center@umich.edu">hearing your ideas</a> about mobile computing at <nobr>U-M.</nobr> Please:</p>

<ul>
<li>Take a moment and check out the website and app.</li>
<li>Join in the conversation in the <a href="http://mobileapps.its.umich.edu/dev/forum?utm_source=targeted%2Bemail&utm_medium=email&utm_term=Developer%2BForum&utm_content=third%2Bemail%2Blink&utm_campaign=Developer%2BForum%2BLaunch">developer&rsquo;s forum</a>.</li>
<li>Tell us about your mobile app resources.</li>
<li>Share your vision of mobile computing.</li>
</ul>

<p>Thank you for your time and I look forward to hearing your thoughts and comments on this campus-wide initiative.</p>
