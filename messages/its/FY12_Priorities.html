<h2 style="font-size:14pt; color:#005596;">FY12 Priorities Set for ITS</h2>

<p>The B&F FY12 Priorities and CIO designated priorities were shared with the B&F Extended Forum last Thursday. I'm delighted that our direction for FY12 is clearly defined, and that I'm able to share these with you. As you know, we use these priorities to guide our work efforts and help us align staff assignments to projects.</p>

<p>The ITS FY12 <a href="https://backstage.its.umich.edu/hr/workplan/ITS_Work_Plan.docx" target="_blank">work plan template</a><span style="display:none;"> [https://backstage.its.umich.edu/hr/workplan/ITS_Work_Plan.docx]</span> is now updated to reflect our priorities. Work that directly contributes to the B&F Strategic Framework priorities and the CIO designated priority projects will be captured in the "priority projects" MAR. All other work efforts should be captured in the remaining MARs. The ITS performance management process is an important component of being a high-performance organization and the work plan is an integral part of this process. I expect all regular staff will have a work plan and will receive regular and meaningful coaching and feedback.</p>

<p>More good news. You've asked for clarity to better understand and balance work priorities across ITS. To that end, the portfolio managers facilitated a prioritization process with ITS group leadership to provide the <a href="http://www.its.umich.edu/about/ITS-Open-Projects.xls" target="_blank">prioritized list</a><span style="display:none;"> [http://www.its.umich.edu/about/ITS-Open-Projects.xls]</span> of all active projects in ITS. The list includes a ranked priority for each active project in our portfolio. Please get familiar with this list. It is the tool to help us strategically assign resources and work collectively toward achieving our goals. It is also important to keep in mind the following as you share with your teams and make resourcing decisions:</p>

<ul>
<li>When resource constraints arise, lower priority projects may need to be delayed to move staff to support higher priority projects.</li>
<li>If there are resource constraints across higher priority projects, leadership will be involved to find resolution.</li>
<li>Production support and delivering services remain vital to our success; we will continue to work on these efforts to ensure our services are reliable and operational.</li>
<li>Keeping our campus community informed is important. We've published our prioritized project portfolio publically on the <a href="http://www.its.umich.edu/about/" target="_blank">ITS website</a><span style="display:none;"> [http://www.its.umich.edu/about/]</span> (click <em>Open Projects</em>). If someone questions the work we are doing, we welcome the opportunity to discuss and confirm alignment of the value we strive to provide with the campus community we serve.</li>
</ul>

<p>More information regarding the portfolio management process will be coming to you soon from the Enterprise Portfolio and Project Management team.</p>

<p>We all know the amount of work we have ahead of us and how important it is for the future of the University. I am proud to work with you all and have the highest confidence in our continued success.</p>

<p>I wanted you to be the first to know, and I plan on sending this same announcement to ITS all staff this week.</p>

<p>Thank you and Go Blue!</p>

<p>Laura</p>
