<img src="http://www.itcs.umich.edu/messages/its/its-banner.png" width="640" height="59" alt="Information and Technology Services (ITS)"><p>

<p>As mentioned in an article in the <a href="https://backstage.itcs.umich.edu/news/news@/back-issue.php?issue_id=1241" target="_blank">April 16 News@ITS</a><span style="display:none;"> [https://backstage.itcs.umich.edu/news/news@/back-issue.php?issue_id=1241]</span>, the IT Rationalization Project Team, including ITS and Accenture staff, is well underway in conducting a current state capability assessment of ITS. The goal of the assessment is to develop a detailed picture of the capabilities readily available across the department. All ITS technologies are in scope, except for telephone systems. Immediately after the capability assessment is completed, the project team will develop an organizational readiness assessment that will identify the degree of investment required to expand services in desired directions in the future based on current capabilities.</p>

<p>The ITS capability assessment is divided into six areas of focus:</p>

<ul>
<li>Strategic IT alignment</li>
<li>IT Governance</li>
<li>Architecture Management</li>
<li>Solutions Delivery</li>
<li>Service Management and Operations (includes end user support)</li>
<li>Workforce and Resource Management</li>
</ul>

<p>In total, the project team will conduct nine workshops and approximately 40 interviews involving about 50 ITS staff. In addition, Accenture will draw on data provided by multiple sources, including ITS financial, staffing and operational data, and hardware and software inventories.</p>

<p>We completed on Wednesday the ITS assessment workshops. Additional follow-up interviews with ITS staff will continue into May.</p>

<p>Since the project began in earnest two months ago, the project team has conducted over 50 unit assessment workshops across campus involving all 19 schools and colleges and major institutes. This intensive data-gathering effort is anticipated to be complete by the second week in May. The next phase of the project, which will take the rest of May, involves completion of current state service and financial reports followed by a validation process with the units.</p>
